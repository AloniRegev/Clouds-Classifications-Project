# Clouds-Classifications-Project
Class project in a deep learning course at the University of Haifa. 

## Objectives:
Classify clouds using radar images into 11 different classifications:
```
0 = No clouds or missing data
1 = Very low clouds
2 = Low clouds
3 = Mid-level clouds
4 = High opaque clouds
5 = Very high opaque clouds
6 = Fractional clouds
7 = High semitransparant thin clouds
8 = High semitransparant moderately thick clouds
9 = High semitransparant thick clouds
10 = High semitransparant above low or medium clouds
```
