# Building defense against adversarial examples in NN
Final project in a deep learning course at the University of Haifa. 

## Objectives:
* Attack: deep fool
* Defenses: adversarial training, feature squeezing in the form of median smoothing. Each one done separately against the given attack

## Data set:
Cifar10
